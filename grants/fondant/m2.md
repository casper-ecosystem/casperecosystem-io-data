### Description

Create dockerization of the Fondant application covering the basic functionalities

This version of an app should handle some basic functionalities like spinning the docker and interacting with it using the Command Line Interface. The basic functionalities include getting the network basic config data (ports, num of blocks, last block, peers etc).

- Container #1
    - Frontend built using React (will provide low fidelity mockups next week)
    - It will spin as a first and after `API`'s `/health-check` endpoint will respond it will be usable
    - The UI will be operable and you will be able to edit [CHAINSPEC](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/release-1.5.1/resources/local/chainspec.toml.in) using forms
    - Also you can set how many nodes you want to spin `nodes = NUM`
    - Also you can set delays `delays = NUM`
    - Then click `START`
    - The you can control the network or `STOP` it.
    - The whole configuration can be dumped to file.

- Container #2
    - The image will have lean node.js Express API which will have a few endpoint:
        - `/start` with a body containing 
        ```bash
            {
                node: numeric,
                delays: numeric,
                chainspec?: TOML serialized to string
            }
        ```
        - `/stop`
        ```bash
            {
                saveConfig: boolean
            }
        ```
        - `/status` - it will return the current status of the network
        - `/rpc/node-X` - RPC endpoint where X is a number of node
        - `/status/node-X` - REST status endpoint where X is a number of node
        - `/sse/node-X/` - SSE endpoint where X is a number of node
