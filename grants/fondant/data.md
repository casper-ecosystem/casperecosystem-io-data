Fondant: Ganache-like testing environment for Casper blockchain.

As we are developing Casper blockchain apps, recently FriendlySoccer.io, we've noticed the need for an integrated testing environment. We need the Ganache
equivalent in Casper Ecosystem: Quickly fire up a personal Casper network on your machine. You can run tests, explore blocks, and inspect the state while
controlling how the chain operates. Everything is wrapped up in a clean and intuitive UI.
