### Description

Create an implementation of Casper-connector.
● Implement smart contract level logic of redstone payload parsing, signature and timestamp verification and value aggregation
● Prepare a way to configure authorised signers public keys, minimal signers count threshold, timestamp validation rules and aggregation logic
● Implement a front-end side SDK for getting the redstone payload and attaching it to the users’ transactions
● Implement unit & integration testing
●  Prepare unit tests for
    ○  Signature verification
    ○  Timestamp validation
    ○  Value aggregation
    ○  Checking the sufficiency of unique signers count
    ○  Getting oracle value for the specified identifiers
●  Prepare integration tests, checking
○  End to end oracle value consumption with the valid redstone
payload
    ○  Failures for invalid or missing redstone payload
    ○  Failures for the insufficient number of unique signers, invalid signers, outdated data, or missing data feeds
There's a one-time integration payment. However, if there are changes in your infrastructure that render our Casper-conector non-functional, we reserve the right to request an additional fee for updating the connector's code or to discontinue providing our data feeds in the Casper ecosystem. Such occurrences will be discussed and negotiated on a case-by-case basis.


### Acceptance Criteria

Definition of done: Well-working SDK.
