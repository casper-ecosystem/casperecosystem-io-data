GuardianLink is launching an exciting new game called Tornado Master, which will be built on the Casper Network ecosystem. 

This is a hyper casual game and is targeted to users all over the world across age groups. 

The Tornado Master Game is a popular mobile game that lets players go on an exciting coin quest while competing with opponents in an attempt to become king coin master. It has exciting features such as coin quests and tornados which can be used to create havoc in the game world while the player works towards becoming the king coin master. 
The tornadoes can be used on buildings and monuments as well as to gain gold and resources as well as to upgrade houses and cities as the player works towards building their utopia.

Integrating Casper with Jump.trade will seamlessly support gaming projects across the Casper blockchain ecosystem enabling collection sales and trades and Jump.trade's high liquidity would further accelerate ecosystem growth.
